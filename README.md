Things Remembered Engraving Prototype


This is a prototype of a preview engraving kiosk. With this people can go to the Things Remembered store and see what an item would look like after it had been engraved.


The box consists of a small projector and 2 mirrors to create an image on the item. Their is a tablet on the front of the device that controls the projector. Right under the projector is a servo with a white card to block the projector before in use. The servo is controlled by an arduino using the "knob" sketch. This was for demontrating purposes I can control when the image from the tablet is being projected.
