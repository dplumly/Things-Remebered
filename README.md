Things Remembered Engraving Prototype


This is a prototype of a preview engraving kiosk that would live in the Things Remembered store. With this people can go to  Things Remembered and see what an item would look like after it had been engraved without actally engraving the item.


The box consists of a small projector and 2 mirrors to create an image on the item. Their is a tablet on the front of the box that controls the projector. Right under the projector is a servo with a white card to block the projector light before I need it to project the image. The servo is controlled by an arduino using the "knob" sketch. This is for demontrating purposes so I can control when the image from the tablet is being projected.
